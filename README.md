# bracket-madness

This is bracket-madness, an interactive NCAA March Madness Tournament bracket. Yes, I know that there are places
where this already exists. I thought it would be fun to try to make one on my own. There isn't much in this README
as of right now but I am sure there will be more in the future!


#### Here is a little backstory for you
I really like TypeScript, so I wanted to try to make something in it. I modeled the data that I got off of the Sportrader US API.
This is still a work in progress, but it should be done before the March Madness tournament is over.
